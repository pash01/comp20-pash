1. This Git reposity stores work completed for the COMP20/Web Programming course taken at Tufts University. It includes web applications that play a video with subtitles, store and display messages entered by the user, and show other students' geolocation on a map.

2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 2: Historic Landmarks. During this assignment, I really got to see how much I had learned in the course and put it into practice. This assignment felt useful, like something I may have to implement in real-world web programming. I liked interacting with the Googlemaps API and seeing my accomplishments on screen as I completed different steps of the assignment.
