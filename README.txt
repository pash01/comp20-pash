1. This Git reposity stores work completed for the COMP20/Web Programming course taken at Tufts University. It 
includes web applications that play a video with subtitles, store and display messages entered by the user, and show 
other students' geolocation on a map.

2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 2: Historic Landmarks. During this assignment, I really got to see how much I 
had learned in the course and put it into practice. This assignment felt useful, like something I may have to 
implement in real-world web programming. I liked interacting with the Googlemaps API and seeing my accomplishments on 
screen as I completed different steps of the assignment. 

3. I think I have grown a lot since the first day of this course. I came in with some coding background, but with no 
knowledge about web programming. I have learned the basis of what web programming is and how it works since Day 1 of 
this class.

4. The most important thing I've learned in this course was how to code in HTML and Javascript. Even though this is 
basic, I think it gave me the tools to learn further in web programming. Before this class, I didn't know anything 
about how a website is even made. In assignment 1, we learned the basics of web programming by creating own our 
portfolios (using HTML and CSS files). In assignment 2, we delved deeper into web prorgramming by learning how to use 
external APIs, JSON, and XMLHttpRequests. I feel like this gave me a good understanding of how websites are made and 
maintained. Learning the basics of HTML and javascript has set me up to learn more about web programming on my own.

5. I would like to learn more about security. I'm curious about how different sites and databases keep their 
information secure, and what levels of security exist. For example, it's significantly more important that the CIA 
keeps their information secure than it is that omfgdogs.com is a secure site, so I'm interested in learning more about 
the steps taken to make a site "extra" secure. Additionally, I'm curious about what happens when there are security 
breeches to important sites.
